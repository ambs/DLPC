## DLPC – *Dicionário da Língua Portuguesa Contemporânea*

This is a repository of the *Dicionário da Língua Portuguesa Contemporânea* (DLPC).

The DLPC is a monolingual Portuguese dictionary published by [Academia das Ciências de Lisboa](http://www.acad-ciencias.pt/) (ACL). It contains around 70,000 entries and was published in 2001 in two volumes, totalling 3880 pages.

The PDF version of the printed edition was converted into XML using a customised version of the P5 schema of the TEI, while a custom-built dictionary writing system using TEI as a data model in the backend was developed to serve as an editing environment for the new and improved online edition of the dictionary.



### TEI Lex-0 in action
The DLPC is currently being converted to the [TEI Lex-0](https://dariah-eric.github.io/lexicalresources/pages/TEILex0/TEILex0.html#index.xml-body.1_div.2_div.2) format, a baseline TEI schema for encoding dictionaries, for data interoperability purposes. I'm working on making this major dictionary TEI Lex–0 native with the supervision of Toma Tasovac.

This directory collects samples of dictionary entries (xml and image) to illustrate TEI Lex-0 application.
