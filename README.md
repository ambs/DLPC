A repository for Portuguese Academy Dictionary TEI Lex-0 encoding

The Dicionário da Língua Portuguesa Contemporânea (DLPC) is a monolingual Portuguese dictionary published by Academia das Ciências de Lisboa (2001).
This dictionary is currently being converted to the TEI Lex-0 format by me and Toma Tasovac.
